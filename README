*** Webloop ***

Probably the most crazy thing i've ever coded: A server side web sythesizer.

It's based on the new http streaming stuff that apple built into iPhoneOS 3.0 and OS X Snow Leopard.
Sound generation is done in Ruby and via sndlib.

The name is derived from Nanoloop (see www.nanoloop.com) from which I also "stole" the pattern editor design.

Needs "sndlib":https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/sndlib/ installed.

Needs "ffmpeg" with lame support installed.

Currently data storage for the patterns happens in a text file. That may or may not be a bad idea.

To see it in action, install the dependencies and start the sinatra app:

$ ruby app.rb

on another terminal, start the soundgenerator:

$ ruby soundgenerator.rb

You will also have to adjust the soundgenerator.rb for your server setup, especially the path written to
the playlist file (see comment around line 123).

Now you can direct your Safari browser to http://localhost:4567

If your Safari version is recent enough, AND you are on Snow leopard, you will eventually (maybe after some reloads) hear
music generated by the pattern you see. 

pattern.yml is random shit, don't hold me responsible for this not being proper music :)

*** State of this ***

This is a hack. It assumes a lot about the runtime environment and I haven't tried to deploy this anywhere.
