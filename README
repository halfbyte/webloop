*** Webloop ***

This is the second iteration on the idea of a synthesizer in the web.

This time around, it's another crazy thing: software synthesis in javascript. Yes, that's possible.

What is currently not possible is to output calculated sound data via javascript, so for that purpose, I use a simple flash applet.

The name is derived from Nanoloop (see www.nanoloop.com) from which I also "stole" the pattern editor design.

To see it in action, install the dependencies and start the sinatra app:

$ ruby app.rb

Now you can direct your Safari browser to http://localhost:4567

If your browser is fast enough and it does support flash, you can press the link that says "play" and then you should hear the
sounds of my javascript only synthesizer.

*** Issues***

As it seems, the flash applet I use to stream the sound, has some issues in that it sometimes hogs way too much CPU.
I wasn't able to debug that.

Feel free to report issues to http://github.com/halfbyte/webloop/issues


pattern.yml is random shit, don't hold me responsible for this not being proper music :)
